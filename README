- What is it?

	Pandra (PHP-Cassandra) is a light-weight PHP based create/read/update/delete (CRUD) layer for the Cassandra distributed datastore.  
	Sitting ontop of the generated Thrift Interface files, it suits as a factory patterned rapid prototyping tool.

	"Cassandra is a highly scalable, eventually consistent, distributed, structured key-value store. 
	 Cassandra brings together the distributed systems technologies from Dynamo and the data model from Google's BigTable. 
	 Like Dynamo, Cassandra is eventually consistent. Like BigTable, Cassandra provides a ColumnFamily-based data model richer than typical key/value systems.

	 Cassandra was open sourced by Facebook in 2008, where it was designed by one of the authors of Amazon's Dynamo. 
	 In a lot of ways you can think of Cassandra as Dynamo 2.0. Cassandra is in production use at Facebook but is still under heavy development."

	Pandra can be installed and interfaced in a few minutes, building your API or web service on a highly redundant datastore can be realised with relative ease.
